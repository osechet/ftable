# ftable
The FTable library defines an improved JTable that helps to easily define the formatting of each cell. If you are tired about fighting with the default cell rendering of the JTable, the FTable may be for you. A first version is already available. The main features are here. Bugs still exist but the library is working.

This is a fork of my old project on Kenai.com. Kenai is closing in 2017 and the data won't be accessible there after that.
